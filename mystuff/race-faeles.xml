    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Not much is known about this race of small, catlike humanoids. Supposedly they hail from the far north, but even that information has been vagued by obscurity.</p>

      <h4>Magical Affinity</h4>
      <p>Most faeli are born with an innate affinity for magic. Be it library-dwelling scholars or swird-swinging warriors, magic always intertwines their goals and everyday lives.</p>
      
      <h4>FAELES TRAITS</h4>
      <p>Your faeles character has certain characteristics in common with all other faeli.</p>
      <p>

        <span class="feature">Age.</span>Faeli reach physical maturity around age 10 to 15, but can live to be over a thousand years old.<br />
        <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Faeli typically care about their own place in the world most of all, tending towards neutral alignments.<br />

    <description>
      <p>Feralborn faeli were brought into the world with an uncommon faeles birth defect that prevents them from using or storing any sort of magic. They have more catlike features, including a thin layer or fur that covers their body. NOTE: This type of faeles is incapable of casting spells! Do not take any classes that are capable of casting spells!</p>
